<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Toilet Tank Fill Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Float Ball</li><li>Float Cup</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial toilet tank fill valve market includes two primary types: float ball and float cup valves. Float ball valves utilize a buoyant ball attached to a lever, which rises and falls with water levels, controlling the fill mechanism. Conversely, float cup valves employ a cylindrical float that moves up and down along the valve stem, allowing for a more compact design.
