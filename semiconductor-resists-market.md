<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Resists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Resist</li><li>Negative Resist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The semiconductor resists market is primarily divided into positive and negative resists, each serving distinct purposes in lithography processes. Positive resists become soluble upon exposure to light, allowing for precise patterning of circuit features by removing exposed areas. In contrast, negative resists harden upon exposure, making the unexposed areas soluble; this enables the creation of robust structures. Both types are essential for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, influencing device performance and miniaturization in technology development.</p></p>
